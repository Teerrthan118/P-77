        <p>The console screen tells what is happening in the app, and also if there are any errors in the code. You can open the console screen by right-clicking, clicking on Inspect and going to console. To write on the console, you use the code: console.log</p>
        <script>
            var message="My First Console Project";
            console.log(message);

            var first_name="Teerrthan";
            var last_name="Mayuran";
            var full_name=first_name.concat(last_name);
            console.log(full_name);

            var a=10;
            var b=5;

            var add=a+b;
            console.log(add);
            
            var minus=a-b;
            console.log(minus);

            var multiply=a*b;
            console.log(multiply);

            var divide=a/b;
